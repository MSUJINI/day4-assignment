Step-by-Step Instructions to Solve the Pipeline Configuration Problem:
1. Building the Application (Build Stage)
Install Jenkins:

Ensure Jenkins is installed on your system or server.
Start Jenkins by navigating to its localhost URL in your browser.
Create a New Job:

Create a new Jenkins job by selecting 'New Item' from the sidebar menu.
Provide a name for your job and select 'Pipeline' as the type of project.
Configure SCM (Source Code Management):

In the job configuration, specify your repository URL (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket).
Set up the necessary credentials to access your repository if required.
Write the Jenkinsfile for the Build Stage:

In the pipeline script, define a stage named Build.
Use the relevant build commands to compile or prepare your application.
Example for a Python application: Ensure Python and necessary dependencies (defined in requirements.txt) are installed.
2. Running Tests (Test Stage)
Add a Test Stage to the Jenkinsfile:

Define a stage named Test in your pipeline script.
Ensure the relevant test framework (e.g., pytest for Python) is installed.
Use commands to execute test scripts and capture test results.
Configure Test Reporting:

Optionally, use Jenkins plugins for test reporting to visualize results.
Reports can include various formats such as JUnit, Cobertura, etc.
3. Deploying the Application (Deploy Stage)
Create an EC2 Instance:

Launch an EC2 instance on AWS, ensuring it is configured to accept necessary deployments.
Set up SSH access to your EC2 instance.
Add a Deploy Stage to the Jenkinsfile:

Define a stage named Deploy in your pipeline script.
Use SSH commands or AWS CLI to copy application files to the EC2 instance.
Optionally, include steps to restart application services or set up environment variables.
4. Configuring Build Triggers
Branch-based Build Triggers:

Under the job's configuration, navigate to the 'Build Triggers' section.
Select 'GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling' or 'Poll SCM' for periodic checks.
Webhooks:

Configure a webhook in your repository settings that points to your Jenkins server.
This allows Jenkins to start a build whenever there are commits pushed to the repository.
5. Committing Changes
Commit Your Jenkinsfile:
Ensure your Jenkinsfile is properly committed to the repository.
Write a meaningful commit message such as "Add CI pipeline setup for build, test, and deploy".
6. Pushing Changes and Creating a Pull Request
Push Changes to Remote Repository:

Push your local changes to the remote repository under a feature branch, e.g., feature-aws-ci.
Create a Pull Request:

Navigate to your repository on the hosting platform (e.g., GitHub).
Open a Pull Request to merge your feature-aws-ci branch into the main branch.
