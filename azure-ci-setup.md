Step-by-Step Instructions to Solve the Pipeline Configuration Problem:
1. Building the Application (Build Stage)
Set Up a CI Tool:

You can use a CI/CD tool like Azure DevOps Pipelines, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI.
Create a New Pipeline:

For example, in Azure DevOps:
Navigate to Pipelines > Create Pipeline.
Connect to your Git repository (e.g., GitHub, Azure Repos).
Configure the Build Process:

Define the build stage in your pipeline configuration (e.g., YAML file for Azure Pipelines).
Specify the build environment and prerequisites (e.g., Node.js, Python, Docker, etc.).
Include steps to compile or prepare the application:
Install necessary dependencies.
Run build commands to compile or package the application.
Store Build Artifacts:

Save the build artifacts for subsequent stages (testing and deployment).
2. Running Tests (Test Stage)
Add a Test Stage to the Pipeline:

Define a test stage in your pipeline configuration.
Install necessary test dependencies and frameworks (e.g., pytest for Python).
Execute Test Scripts:

Include commands to run the test suite and capture results.
Optionally, configure test coverage and reporting tools.
Publish Test Results:

Use the appropriate tools/plugins to publish test results within the CI/CD platform for visibility.
3. Deploying the Application (Deploy Stage)
Create an Azure VM:

Set up an Azure Virtual Machine for deploying your application.
Ensure the VM is configured to accept SSH connections and applicable security settings.
Add a Deploy Stage to the Pipeline:

Define a deploy stage in your pipeline configuration.
Use Azure CLI or SSH to transfer application files to the Azure VM.
Execute necessary commands on the VM to set up and start the application.
For example, copying files, setting environment variables, restarting services, etc.
4. Configuring Build Triggers
Automatic Build Triggers:
In your CI/CD tool, configure the pipeline to automatically trigger builds on code changes.
For example, in Azure Pipelines -> Trigger: configure CI triggers for branches or pull requests.
Ensure the repository is configured to send webhooks or notifications to the CI/CD tool on push events.
5. Committing Changes
Commit Your Pipeline Configuration:
Ensure your pipeline configuration file (e.g., azure-pipelines.yml) is committed to the repository.
Write a meaningful commit message such as "Add CI pipeline configuration for build, test, and deploy stages".
6. Pushing Changes and Creating a Pull Request
Push Changes to Remote Repository:

Push the local changes to the remote repository under a feature branch, e.g., feature-azure-ci.
Create a Pull Request:

Navigate to your repository on the hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, Azure Repos).
Open a Pull Request to merge your feature-azure-ci branch into the main branch.
Provide a clear title and description for the pull request, summarizing the changes made.
By following these detailed steps, you can configure an efficient CI/CD pipeline to build, test, and deploy an application to an Azure VM, ensuring it is optimized for competitive programming test cases and effective deployments.
