Step-by-Step Instructions to Set Up CI/CD Pipeline with CircleCI and Google Compute Engine (GCP)
1. Building the Application (Build Stage)
Set Up CircleCI Account:

Sign up for CircleCI if you don't already have an account.
Connect your CircleCI account to your code repository (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket).
Create a .circleci/config.yml File:

In your repository, create a directory named .circleci and within it, a file named config.yml.
In config.yml, define the build job:
Specify the Docker image (or machine executor) that will be used for the build environment.
Define the steps required to build your application:
Checkout the code from the repository.
Install any required dependencies.
Run the build commands to compile or package the application.
Store Build Artifacts:

Configure CircleCI to save build artifacts required for later stages.
2. Running Tests (Test Stage)
Add a Test Job to the config.yml File:
Within the config.yml file, define a test job:
Ensure the test environment has the necessary dependencies and frameworks installed.
Specify steps to run the test suite:
Execute test commands and scripts.
Collect and report test results.
Configure Test Reporting:
Use CircleCI's store_test_results and store_artifacts steps to save and upload test results and reports.
3. Deploying the Application (Deploy Stage)
Set Up Google Cloud SDK:

Before deployment, ensure that the Google Cloud SDK is installed and configured within your CircleCI environment.
Add a Deploy Job to the config.yml File:

In your config.yml file, define a deploy job:
Authenticate with Google Cloud using a service account key.
Use the gcloud command line tool to deploy the application to a Google Compute Engine (GCE) instance.
Transfer necessary application files to the GCE instance.
SSH into the GCE instance and execute deployment commands (e.g., starting services, setting up environment variables).
Setting Up GCE Instance:

Ensure that the GCE instance is up and running with SSH access properly configured.
Optionally, configure firewall rules to allow traffic on necessary ports.
4. Configuring Build Triggers
Automatic Build Triggers:
In your CircleCI project settings, configure build triggers to start builds on code changes:
Enable automatic builds for specific branches or on push events.
Ensure your repository webhooks are correctly set up to notify CircleCI on code changes.
5. Committing Changes
Commit Your CircleCI Configuration:
Ensure your .circleci/config.yml file is added to your repository.
Write a clear, descriptive commit message such as "Add CircleCI configuration for build, test, and deploy stages".
6. Pushing Changes and Creating a Pull Request
Push Changes to Remote Repository:

Push your local changes to the remote repository under a dedicated feature branch, e.g., feature-gcp-ci.
Create a Pull Request:

Navigate to your repository hosting platform (e.g., GitHub).
Open a Pull Request to merge your feature-gcp-ci branch into the main branch.
Provide a detailed title and description for the PR, explaining the changes made in the pipeline configuration.
By following these instructions, you will have a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using CircleCI that builds, tests, and deploys your application to a Google Compute Engine instance, optimized for handling various test cases and deployment scenarios.
